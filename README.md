# Twilight Imperium 4th Edition Companion App

## Purpose of the App

Twlight Imperium 4th Edition is a board game published by Fantasy Flight Games. It sees up to six players take control
of galactic civilizations in a race to gain control of the galaxy and become the new imperial power. The game is notoriously
large, and takes up a sizable table to play even with only three players. A large part of this is down to the numerous cards
and tokens needed for upkeep.

The aim of this app is to digitise a sizable portion of this allowing for the game to be played in a smaller space. It should
also make playing the game a little simpler by automating a portion of the upkeep and tracking that players would otherwise
need to do.

It will allow players to effecitivly "save" their games so that they can pack the box away, and then re-start their
game at a new time without losing any progress.
